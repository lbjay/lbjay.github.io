Last Tuesday I got the chance to sit around for a day with a bunch of talented library & academic technology folks as part of the 1st ever gather of [NEcode4lib][1], the New England &#8220;chapter&#8221; of the [code4lib][2] community. We met at the [Boston Public Library][3] and took turns giving short presentations on a variety of topics. I didn&#8217;t take <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">great</span>any notes, but thankfully [others][4] [did][5].

The thing I presented on is only about halfway (if that) between an interesting hack and something actually useful. It&#8217;s an attempt to create an article metadata scraping service using the CiteULike Plugins. I got the idea a while back from reading [this blog post][6]. The basic idea is you take the CiteULike plugins, which are a set of HTML scrapers written in a variety of languages, wrap them in a web service that accepts a URL and a format, and then provide a bookmarklet. A &#8220;user&#8221; viewing an article at a publisher&#8217;s site can then click the bookmarklet and get the article metadata in a variety of formats.

Links:

  * slides from the talk are [here][7]
  * As of now the service is available [here][8]
  * the bookmarklet is [here][9]

Some directions I&#8217;m interested in taking this:

  * Create a proper python library wrapper for the plugins
  * Implement the [unAPI][10] 300 response providing links to the resource in the available formats. Otherwise the bookmarklet will be restricted to a default format. Or you&#8217;d need a separate bookmarklet for each format
  * Add [COinS][11] as an output format, i.e. TinyOpenUrl
  * Try the same concept but using [SpiderMonkey][12] & the [Zotero Translators][12]

***Update: January 15, 2009 @ 11:08***

*I&#8217;m disabling the demo service linked to above for the time being until I have an opportunity to improve it and make it actually useful/functional.*
