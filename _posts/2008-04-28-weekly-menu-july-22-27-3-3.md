**Notes: **

It&#8217;s already Monday morning as I&#8217;m writing this up so including some updates here. Yes, I made a Banana Cream Pie. It would have been better served in a bowl. The filling just didn&#8217;t set all the way, but not sure if I needed a bit more cornstarch or just more time in the fridge.

The steaks were *amazing*. It was actually the first time for us having actual steaks from the CSA share. We were warned that they would be very unlike traditional, corn-fed and thoroughly marbled beef. This was true. There was some additional chewing effort involved and the taste was more&#8230; earthy? Delicious.
