I knew I had the makings of a shephards pie (except the lamb) but couldn&#8217;t find an exact recipe to match what I had available, so I ended up taking ideas from two separate recipes. One was from Didi Emmon&#8217;s Vegetable Planet, the other from [Allrecipes.com][1].

For the veggie base, use 2 tbs olive oil to saute:

  * 1 white onion, diced
  * 2 cloves garlic, minced
  * 1 T. curry powder (I used something from Penzy&#8217;s called Maharajah
  * 1/2 t. fresh ground cumin

The curry will brown a bit on the bottom of the pan which is ok, but don&#8217;t let it blacken. When the onion has softened, add:

  * 2 medium carrots, chopped
  * 3 medium zucchini, chopped
  * 1 cup chicken broth
  * salt &#038; pepper

The curry acted as a bit of a thickener, so I added more chicken broth occasionally to keep it somewhat stewish. This cooked for about 20 minutes. Then I added about 2/3 of a cup of cooked coarse bulgar. I think the idea here is that the bulgar cooks a bit more during baking and help absorb some of the additional liquid from the zucchini. At least that was my intention; it seemed to do the trick.

For the topping I mixed

  * 4 smallish russet potatoes, peeled, boiled and mashed
  * 1/2 cup of plain greek yogurt
  * 2 tbls olive oil
  * salt &#038; pepper
  * 1 cup frozen peas

The veggies went into a cassarole/pie thing. Spread the potato mixture over that, then I grated a couple of tablespoons of romano on top. Baked at 400 for 15 minutes, then switched to the broiler for 5 more mintues to get the top nice and brown.

For a last-minute throw-together meal, we were both surprised by how good this turned out. Which is why I figured I&#8217;d better make a note of how I did it.
