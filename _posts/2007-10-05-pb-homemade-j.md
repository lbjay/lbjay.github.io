This one&#8217;s been stuck in the Flickr queue for a couple of weeks. Also it wasn&#8217;t truly Peanut Butter, but Sunflower Butter. It just seems so awkward to call it a SFB &#038; J.

The jelly is grape and was made by my neighbor Leah from <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord_grape' target='_blank'>Concord grapes</a> growing on a trellis right out her back door.

The pile &#8216;o&#8217; orange in the foreground is some delicious carrot slaw made with honey, walnuts and dried cranberries.
