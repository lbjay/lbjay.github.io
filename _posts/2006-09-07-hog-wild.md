Jenny &#038; I had the pleasure of attending the opening game of the Arkansas Razorbacks football season in Fayetteville, AR last weekend. If you&#8217;ve never experienced the tailgate scene surrounding Razorback home games, it looks something like this:

Our seats, FYI, were about 10 rows down from the top, right below that middle light pole.

The huge Razorback smoker pictured sits at a point above the north rim of the stadium and is visible from just about any seat. When the Hogs score a touchdown, it emits a blast of smoke from the snout, like this:<img align="middle" title="The Razorback Smoker (closeup)" id="image26" alt="The Razorback Smoker (closeup)" src="http://blog.reallywow.com/static/uploads/2006/09/p1010040.jpg" />

I wish I could say I got to try some of those ribs, but we&#8217;d already feasted on some delicious tailgate fare provided by a friend of my Dad&#8217;s.

Final score: USC Trojans 50, Razorbacks 14. Thanks to Uncle Joe &#038; Melva for the tix.
