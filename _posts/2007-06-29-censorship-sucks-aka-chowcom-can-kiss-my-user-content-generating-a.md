<img style="float:right" src='http://www.f00die.com/static/uploads/2007/06/chow.gif' alt='Chow, baby.' />The other day, in response to a Chow.com post requesting suggestions for good eats near the Cambridge/Belmont line, I received the following message from the moderators at Chow.com:

bq. \*Subject: Chowhound &#8211; Note from Moderator\*

Hi lbjay, you&#8217;ve been sent the following by a Chowhound moderator:  
We are not currently accepting postings about Craigie Street Bistrot. Please refrain from posting further about this place while we investigate a problem with some postings about this restaurant.

\*Your post:\*

> \_I bet you&#8217;re within walking distance of Craigie Street Bistro, just over the Cambridge line. Follow Mt.Auburn until it crosses Rt 2/3/16 (whatever the heck that is at that point) and becomes Brattle Street. It&#8217;s maybe another 1/4 mile past there? http://www.craigiestreetbistrot.com/\_

Huh, ok. 

Undaunted, I returned to the discussion thread and posted a second time, this time suggesting that the person check out a &#8220;bistro&#8221; nearby on a street that &#8220;rhymes with \_Graigie\_&#8221;. This post was apparently yanked as well, although I didn&#8217;t receive a second notification from the moderators.

The mystery to me is, are the chow.com moderators really so dumb that they can&#8217;t distiguish between a legitimate post and comment spam? I&#8217;m assuming they have some kind of automatic flagging system that catches comments that contain references to &#8220;Craigie Street Bistro&#8221;. But once these messages are caught it shouldn&#8217;t take an Einstein to assess whether they are spam or not spam. Idiots.

PS, [Craigie Street Bistro][1] rocks.
