[A great Op-Ed][1] in the Globe yesterday by Christopher Kimball, the founder of one of my favorite recipe sources, [Cook&#8217;s Illustrated][2].

What consumers should want &#8212; good flavor and good health &#8212; has been replaced by what the industry wants &#8212; an addiction to expensive, highly processed trademarked brands that will burden our health system and lead to a much lower quality of life.&#8221;*
