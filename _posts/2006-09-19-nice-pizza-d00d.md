Some guy spent six years and probably tons of $$ trying to replicate the pies from his favorite pizza shop. He finally [succeeded][1] apparently (you may have to follow the &#8220;mirrored by&#8221; links at the top). It&#8217;s hard to blame him; it looks like a pretty damn good pie.

The key things, according to Jeff:

  1. High heat, preferably 825F
  2. Proper kneading technique
  3. The right kind of yeast

I (unintentionally) got my grill up to about 650 degrees during our recent [block party][2]. I wonder if that would be good enough&#8230;

Bonus: there&#8217;s a link to an [online shop][3] called Sourdo that sells sourdough starters. I&#8217;ve made a couple of psuedo-starters by leaving some yeast, water and flour in the bread machine overnight, but always been on the lookout for the real thing.
