Picked up our [Chestnut Farms][1] cooler last week. It&#8217;s like being in a meat-of-the-month club. This months share included:

  * 1 rack of lamb
  * 4 pork chops
  * 4 beef short ribs
  * 1 lb lamb sausage
  * 1 lb lamb stew meat
  * 2 lbs ground beef
  * 4 lbs chicken breasts

Update: one more item I forgot &#8212; 1 1b. bacon
