I just had the best lunch. I call it the \*Open-Faced Guacwich\*. I&#8217;m kicking myself for not taking a picture (even if it would have been with [my crappy phone cam][1].)

* 1 avocado  
* 1 tomato  
* 1 lime  
* Two slices of sourdough  
* small garlic clove  
* pinch of salt

Toast the bread. While it&#8217;s toasting, mash the avocado with 2 tsp of juice from the lime and a little salt. When the bread is done rub it with the cut side of the garlic clove. Spread the mashed avocado on the toast. Slice the tomato and lay the slices on top of of the mashed avocado.

Mmmm, scarf-alicious.
