Introducing a new category: Don&#8217;t Do This

I read somewhere recently that the juice from a sweet relish makes a tasty salad dressing. This sounded reasonable, but in practice maybe not so much. I tried to transform some late season garden extras into a side dish:

Toss together:

  * A couple of chopped roma tomatoes
  * A handful of tomatillos, also chopped
  * One cucumber, chopped
  * Minced fresh cilantro
  * The liquidy leftovers from [last week&#8217;s relish canning][1] (about 1/3 cup)

Not sure what was wrong, but the concensus between Jenny &#038; I was that it was &#8220;interesting&#8221; but definitely not a keeper.
