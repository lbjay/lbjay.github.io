From the Corner Cafe in Netwon Corner, MA. With extra sauce, please. Yah, it&#8217;s messy. But so good.

This place is run by a nice Greek family. The menu is your basic breakfast/deli place, including omelettes, subs, wraps, salads, etc. But they also have a few excellent Greek items, like <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanakopita' target='_blank'>Spanakopita</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avgolemono' target='_blank'>Avgolemono</a> soup.
