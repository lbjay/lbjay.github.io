Something about the smallish, red &#8220;bunching&#8221; onions that came in our farm share said, &#8220;cook me in the crockpot with some chicken&#8221;, so I improvised a sweet, garlicky dish that we ended up taking over to some friends&#8217; for a &#8220;potluck&#8221;. 

<div class="hrecipe">
  <h3 class="hrecipe-title">
    Honey Garlic Chicken
  </h3>
  
  <p class="hrecipe-summary">
    I like my chicken legs cooked long and slow so pretty much all the fat melts and the meat falls away from the bone. This goes great over boiled brown rice.

  <ul class="hrecipe-ingredients">
    <li class="ingredient">
      1 T cracked green peppercorns
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      1 t cinnamon
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      1 t salt
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      4 skin-on chicken legs (thigh + drumstick)
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      1 T peanut oil
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      1 cup orange juice
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      1/4 cup soy sauce or tamari
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      3 T honey
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      8-10 cloves of garlic, peeled
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      8-10 bunching onions or 16-20 pearl onions
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      2 T chopped thai or sweet basil
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="method">
    <p>
      Mix the salt, pepper and cinnamon. Rub the mixture between the skin and meat of the chicken legs.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Heat the oil over medium-high until just beginning to smoke. Sear the legs, skin side down first, for 3-4 minutes each side. Transfer legs to the crockpot, skin side up.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Add orange juice to the sauté pan and scrape up any browned bits. Add soy sauce and honey and stir until combined. Pour sauce over chicken.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Spread onions and garlic evenly atop and around the legs. Cover and cook on low for four hours.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Transfer chicken to a serving dish and cover or tent with foil to keep warm. Strain sauce back into the sauté pan, reserving onions and garlic, and boil until reduced by half. Add onions and garlic to serving dish. Pour reduced sauce over everything, sprinkle with the basil and serve.
