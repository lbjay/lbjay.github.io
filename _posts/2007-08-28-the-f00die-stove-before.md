        Our trusty <a href="http://easterkiwi.wordpress.com/tag/frigidaire-flair/">Frigidaire Flair</a>. It came with the house and was used from August, 2002 until the remodel in Fall, 2006. It&#8217;s a joy to look at and always prompted comments from visitors.

        Cooking with it was a mixed bag. The dual ovens were nice, but neither were large enough to cook more than a medium-sized broiler chicken, much less the Thanksgiving turkey. The slide out burners were also a cool feature, although the front-left one never worked and the front-right had the strange glitch of having only two settings: Off and Extremely High. Great for boiling water and for stir-fry.

        The under-cabinet stored pots, pans and baking sheets. Several other &#8220;creative&#8221; uses of space can be seen in the photo, such as the hanging pan rack, the knife rack, the pot lid rack. The square, basket-ish thing in the middle shelf of the wood cart was the &#8220;spice drawer&#8221;.<br /> <br clear="all" />
