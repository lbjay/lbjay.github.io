Same Potato &#038; Dill bread from [The Biscuit][1] as [yesterday][2]. Tomato from the garden. Avocado mashed with a little lime juice and salt. Bread toasted and rubbed with a garlic clove. The extra avocado spread on a third slice of toast.

And yes that&#8217;s the same banana from yesterday. I let it ripen another day.
