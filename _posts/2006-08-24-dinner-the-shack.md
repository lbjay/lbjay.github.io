It&#8217;s certainly not our favorite seafood place, but it&#8217;s great for when you&#8217;ve got folks from out of town and a limited amount of time. Normally we would head to <a rel="lightbox" title="Woodman's" href="http://blog.reallywow.com/static/uploads/2006/08/inner_image_cambridge.thumbnail.gif">Woodman&#8217;s</a> or maybe [The Barking Crab][2].

We think they liked it but we were a little suprised that the menu/specials seemed a bit overwhelming. There&#8217;s lots of &#8220;fancier&#8221; items that get top-billing, but the basic stuff can be hard to figure out. You can spend a lot of time searching for something simple like fish &#038; chips&#8211;it&#8217;s under **Fried Food** as *&#8220;beer battered native fish and chips&#8221;.* Not sure if that&#8217;s intentional.  
I had wood-grilled striped bass and it was really excellent. It was a great antidote for my failed attempt to grill some red snapper a few days earlier.
