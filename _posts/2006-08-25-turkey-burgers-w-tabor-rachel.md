Tabor is an ex-co-worker of mine from [Smarter Living][1]. He and his wife, Rachel, just happened to pull up in front of my house last night at the exact moment I was pulling some Turkey Burgers and Sweet Potato Fries off of the grill. He was just dropping off a letter of recommendation for my application to the CompSci masters program at [Tufts][2], but the timing was just too perfect so Jenny &#038; I pounced on them and made them come inside and eat dinner with us. Much fun was had, but it was probably a bit of a shock for them to go from thinking they were just sticking something in the mailbox, to sitting down for dinner, wine, dessert and their first ever shot of Grappa.

Turkey Burgers:

  * 1 lb. ground turkey
  * 3 T ricotta cheese
  * zest of one small orange
  * 1-2 T chopped fresh basil
  * salt &#038; pepper
  * peanut oil

Mix the turkey, ricotta, orange zest &#038; basil. Form into four patties. Make a puddle of the oil on a small plate and turn the patties over in the oil to lightly coat them. Sprinkle on the salt &#038; pepper. Grill. I serve them with toasted buns, sliced tomatoes, lettuce and dijon mustard.
