Last weekend&#8217;s [relish][1] was my second attempt at preserving.

Attempt #1 (several years ago) went awry in the recipe department. I&#8217;d had the brilliant idea to start a homemade pickle company (kinda like what [this guy][2] did,) but first I needed to get just the right recipe. My pickled cukes weren&#8217;t going to be your boring, run-of-the-mill pickles; I used fresh and interesting ingredients, like fancy champagne vinegar, ginger root and kumquats. I remember spending a day in the kitchen preparing a dozen variations of a basic recipe. Then packing the jars and numbering them, keeping a written list of which number corresponded to which recipe variation.

I&#8217;m not sure where that list is anymore, but it doesn&#8217;t matter because it all ended up in the trash anyway. Jar #1 came out waaay too vinegary. I don&#8217;t remember what was up with jar #2. Jar&#8217;s #3-12 were still in my basement until a few days ago, some furry mold beginning to form around the outside of the lid. So sad.
