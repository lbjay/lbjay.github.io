It&#8217;s one of the things that got us through the winter up here. I hope I can still enjoy it as the weather heats up.

Just before you go to bed put the following in the crockpot.

  * 2 cups steel cut oats
  * 1 tsp cinnamon
  * 1 tsp vanilla
  * 1/3 cup brown sugar
  * pinch of salt
  * 8 cups water

You can spray the inside of the pot with some non-stick spray oil. Mine usually sticks anyway, but I think it helps at least. Turn the pot onto low. In the morning you&#8217;ll have some yummy oatmeal. Store it in the fridge all week. Each morning scoop some in a bowl, add some milk and sliced bananas and microwave.

Optional things you can add before cooking:

  * add 1/2 cup of raisins. Personally, I don&#8217;t like the resulting texture.
  * A couple of tablespoons of butter cut in small pieces.

Rumor has it that Oprah **loves** this recipe.
