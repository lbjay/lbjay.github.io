Although it&#8217;s rare I don&#8217;t tweak something here, or substitute something there, when appropriating a recipe, it&#8217;s still good to give credit where due. 

I dig the way JB over at [Urban Drivel][1] credits the source of her recipes in the post title, e.g. **[Basil Risotto | Bon Apetit][2]**. I intend to be a copy cat.
