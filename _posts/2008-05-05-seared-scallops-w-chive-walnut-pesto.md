I haven&#8217;t even made this yet but it sounded good. The idea hit me on the way to work this morning.

Chive-Walnut Pesto:

  * a bunch of fresh chives
  * 1 small clove garlic
  * 1/4 cup toasted walnut pieces
  * 1/4 cup olive oil
  * a couple grinds of salt

Sear the scallops on both sides. Place on a bed of Jasmine Rice (or quinoa mabye?). Spoon pesto over the top. Serve w/ lemon wedges.
