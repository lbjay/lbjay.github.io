Tomato from the garden, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mozzarella' target='_blank'>mozzarella</a> from Fiore Di Nonno, whole wheat <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baguette' target='_blank'>baguette</a> from Hi-Rise. Slathered with homemade <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pesto' target='_blank'>pesto.</a> 

Bread could have been better. It was fresh from yesterday, but I think it stiffened up while the sandwich was in the fridge this morning. That plus it being such a huge sandwich made it tough to eat.

Confession: I originally had some slices of salami on here too (picutred), but it just wasn&#8217;t working and I eventually took them off and ate separately.
