Burned by bad chicken from [Wilson Farm][1] again! I ***love*** Wilson Farm. It is 5 minutes from my house. I do all my weekly shopping there. But. They seem to have some chronic issues keeping their chicken breasts fresh. 

The latest incident involved a package of split breasts purchased on Monday, July 23rd with an expiration stamp of July 27th. I opened the pack last night (July 26th) all set to make [Grilled Chicken w/ Tomato Tarragon sauce][2]. MMmmmm&#8230; smelly chicken!

Fortunately, I had a pack of extra-firm tofu in the fridge. The tweaked-recipe result was delicious.

* 1 package extra-firm tofu  
* 3 roma tomatoes  
* 1/2 clove of garlic  
* 2 T minced fresh tarragon  
* 2 T lemon juice  
* 4 T olive oil  
* salt &#038; pepper

Get the fire started in the grill.

Drain the tofu and press out the excess water by wrapping in paper towels and setting something mildly heavy on top for several minutes. Cut the tomatoes in half and grate them on a box grater. Mix the tomatoes with the tarragon and lemon juice. Use a microplane to grate the garlic into the tomatoes. Whisk in two tablespoons of the oil. Add S &#038; P to taste. That&#8217;s the sauce.

Slice the tofu lengthwise into three slabs, then slice crosswise once so you have six pieces. Sprinkle with S &#038; P and brush with the remaining olive oil (or spray each side with some of that aerosol canola or olive oil). Make sure the grill grates are cleaned and oiled. I keep an old kitchen towel and a can of spray canola oil near the grill just for this purpose; spray the oil on the towel and quickly wipe down the grate. Repeat. Don&#8217;t burn yourself.

Grill the tofu &#8220;cutlets&#8221; for 3-4 minutes on each side. Serve with the tomato sauce spooned over the top.
