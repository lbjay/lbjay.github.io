It&#8217;s a hummus-slinging hole-in-the-wall in downtown Jerusalem. The owner is infamous for rushing customers through their meal once they&#8217;ve been served so that he can turn the table. *&#8220;Don&#8217;t chew&#8211;swallow!&#8221;* and *&#8220;What&#8217;s taking you so long? There&#8217;s no bones in hummus!&#8221;* are were frequently heard examples.

I think the atmosphere has calmed a bit since those days and we were allowed to take our time. Each of us was served what would be a largish salad-plate sized mound of hummus, covered with whole chick peas and swimming in a moat of luscious olive oil. We also finished off a shared dish of beans w/ rice, a plate of stewed okra and a couple dozen falafel. I skipped dinner that night I was still so stuffed.

I&#8217;m not the only one who [enjoyed their visit][1]. And googling for &#8220;Taami Jerusalem&#8221; turned up [this writeup][2] in the Globe that I somehow missed.

Sorry, no recipe available. Also, I didn&#8217;t have a camera and I couldn&#8217;t find any authentic pictures of Taami; the photo above I found online and it is actually from a place called Lina in the Old City where I&#8217;m sure they also have excellent hummus.
