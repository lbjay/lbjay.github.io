One of the shareholders in our CSA contributed this recipe to the newsletter. I haven&#8217;t made it yet, but wanted to save it somewhere outside of my inbox. Our shares have included large quantities of greens, so I&#8217;m always looking for ways to use them up.

    Spanikopita w/ Assorted Greens
  </h3>
  
  <p class="hrecipe-summary">
    This is a slightly non-traditional spanikopita pie made with assorted greens rather than just spinach.
  </p>
  
  <ul class="hrecipe-ingredients">
    <li class="ingredient">
      2 lbs greens (any kind you have mixed together &#8211; spinach, collard greens, swiss chard)
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      1/2 pound feta cheese, crumbled
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      2 eggs
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      several sheets of phyllo dough
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      2 Tbs butter, melted
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      1/8 tsp nutmeg
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="method">
    <p>
      Saute the greens in a Tbs of water, covered, until wilted. Mix them with 2 eggs, feta cheese, and the nutmeg.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Butter a square baking dish (roughly 8&#215;8) and put down a layer of phyllo dough. Lightly butter each layer of phyllo &#8211; if you are using standard thin phyllo put down about 5 layers on the bottom. Put in the green and feta mixture and then put several layers of phyllo on for the top &#8220;crust&#8221;, lightly buttering each layer as you go.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Bake at 375 for about 30 &#8211; 45 minutes or until phyllo dough is golden brown.
