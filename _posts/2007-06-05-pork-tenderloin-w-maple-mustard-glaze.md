I had a couple of pork tenderloins rubbed with some seasoned salt and pepper all set to go on the grill last night. But the weather didn&#8217;t cooperate. The situation called for a last-minute recipe switcheroo, so I dug out an old fave that I haven&#8217;t made in awhile.

  * Rub each tenderloin with about 1 Tbsp of dried sage.
  * Sear the tenderloins in a some butter in a saute pan that has a tight-fitting lid.
  * Once browned on all sides, cover and cook for about 10 minutes over low heat
  * Uncover, remove the tenderloins and set aside
  * Turn the heat back up to med-high adn deglaze the pan with a couple of tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
  * Pour in a mixture of 1/3 cup maple syrup, 1/4 cup cider vinegar and 2 tsp dijon mustard
  * Let the sauce reduce and thicken a bit
  * Add the tenderloins back and roll them around to &#8220;glaze&#8221; them with the sauce
  * Remove from the heat, slice the tenderloins thin (about 1/2 inch) and serve, spooning some sauce over the slices

I think the original source for this recipe was [Epicurious][1], but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve tweaked it since then (as usual). Simple, quick and tasty. Went great with some oven-roasted asparagus.
