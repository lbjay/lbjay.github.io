Ended up stuffing ourselves at [Woodman&#8217;s][1] in Essex on Sunday afternoon. Yummy big bowls of chowder. The [red tide][2] has resulted in local clams being rather dear ($18 for a 1/2 pint), so we settled for haddock sandwiches.

My only complaint about that place is I think there&#8217;s something wrong with how they store the beer in the upstairs bar area. It always tastes a bit skunky. My advice, which I should heed myself more often, is to go with the margaritas.
