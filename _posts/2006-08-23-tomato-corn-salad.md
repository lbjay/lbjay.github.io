This was a keeper I threw together a couple of weeks ago. I&#8217;m doing a good job this summer of keeping up with the cherry tomato production, and quick, cold salads like this are part of the reason. Ours are Super-Sweet 100&#8217;s. Their skins are a touch on the tough side when I&#8217;ve used them in &#8220;cooked&#8221; dishes, like [Spaghetti with Raw Tomatoes and Arugula][1], but they definitely live up to their name.

  * A bunch cherry (or grape) tomatoes. I used about a pint.
  * Some leftover corn-on-the-cob
  * 4-5 medium tomatilloes
  * 2 T fresh basil
  * 2 T lemon juice
  * 1 T red wine vinegar
  * salt and pepper to taste

Quarter the tomatoes. Cut the corn off the cob (I use a steak knife). Dice the tomatilloes. Toss all that together. Add the lemon juice and vinegar and toss some more. Chop the basil and add that with the s &#038; p.
