When I saw the pack of country-style pork ribs in the CSA cooler last month I was a bit nervous about what I&#8217;d do with them. The smoker is covered in snow, plus Jenny isn&#8217;t into ribs anyway. I figured some kind of braise would be best, but the thought of exactly how to cook them kicked around in the back of my mind for several weeks. A search of the inter-tubes turned up something on Epicurious.com that sounded good. With one **major **modification it definitely was.

Heat the oven to 325.

In your favorite braising pot, bring to a boil:

  * 1 3/4 cups orange juice
  * 2 T grated, fresh ginger
  * 1 T grated, fresh garlic
  * 1/4 cup soy sauce or tamari
  * 2 T sugar

I only had about 1 lb of ribs, but you could do as much as 2 lbs probably. Once the sauce is boiling, sprinkle the ribs with some black pepper and lay them into the pot. Roll them once or twice to coat. Cover the pan and put it in the oven. Cook for 2 hours.Take the pan out of the oven and carefully remove the ribs to a serving platter. Put the pan over high heat and reduce the sauce down to 3/4 of a cup. Pour the sauce over the ribs.

Notes:

  * The original recipe called for 1/2 cup soy sauce plus salting the ribs before putting them in the pan. Ouch. Nearly all of the recipe comments indicated it was too salty so I skipped the extra salt and used low-sodium tamari instead. It was **still **pretty salty. Reducing the sauce is really going to concentrate the flavors so I think 1/4 cup is totally enough.
  * The soy + ginger + garlic + sugar is basically how you make Teriyaki sauce, so conceivably you could just use OJ + 1/3 cup Teriyaki if you had a brand you really liked.
