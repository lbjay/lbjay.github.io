It&#8217;s taken me awhile to warm up to [kohlrabi][1]. I&#8217;ve cooked it a few times in the past year, always because it&#8217;s been part of the farm share. If there is such a thing as a mental &#8220;image&#8221; of what something tastes like, I still don&#8217;t really have one for kohlrabi, but I now have a favorite way to prepare it.

    Moroccan Carrot/Kohlrabi Salad
  </h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li class="ingredient">
      2 medium kohlrabi, peeled and cut into chunks
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      5-6 medium carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch sections
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      1 T olive oil
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      1/2 tsp. ground cumin
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      1/2 tsp. cinnamon
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      1/2 tsp. paprika
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      1/4 tsp. cayenne
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      2 T fresh lemon juice
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      2 T minced parsley
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      salt & pepper to taste
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="method">
    Place the carrots and kohlrabi in a saucepan w/ enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and then let them cook for ~10 minutes. You&#8217;re looking for not crunchy but still firm here.
  </p>
  
  <p class="method">
    Drain the veggies really well. Toss with the olive oil to coat. Then add the spices, the lemon juice and the parsley, in that order, tossing each time. The <a href="http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/food/articles/2008/07/23/moroccan_carrot_salad/">original recipe</a> said to let stand for an hour, but we were too hungry. I also halved the spice measurements when I did it; our carrots are fresh from the garden and too tasty to drown them in other flavors.
