Leftover grilled corn-on-the-cob is a great thing to have in the fridge when the volume of ripe grape tomatoes in the garden starts to increase. Possibly inspired by [a great-looking striped bass recipe][1], I threw this salad together last night.

* 4 leftover, grilled ears of corn  
* 1/2 pint grape or cherry tomatoes  
* 1 minced jalapeno  
* 1 T minced curly parsley  
* juice from 1/2 a lime  
* salt &#038; pepper

Over a wide plate, saw the corn off the cob with a serrated knife (a steak knife works well, or you could get yourself one of [these gadgets][2]). Quarter the tomatoes. Toss with the minced jalapeno, parsley, lime juice and s &#038; p.
