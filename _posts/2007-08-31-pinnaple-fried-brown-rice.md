Taking a break from the tomato sandwiches today due to the free lunch provided during the monthly, lunchtime <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew' target='_blank'>Hebrew</a> lessons offered at [my place of employment][1]. 

Pictured is possibly my favorite of several, much-loved dishes from [Amarin of Thailand][2]: Pineapple Fried Rice w/ Brown Rice. This ain&#8217;t your typical fried rice; in addition to pineapple, it includes crab meat, shimp, chicken, snow peas, green peas, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes and some kind of dried, shredded pork stuff on top. 

Mmmmmm&#8230; ani b&#8217;emet ohevet Amarin Thai.
