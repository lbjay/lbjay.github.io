Jennifer & I went to a thing at the [Natick Community Organic Farm][1] on Saturday. It was billed as a &#8220;workshop&#8221; but really just ended up being a nice 2 hour tour of the farm and an informative Q&A session with Director, Lynda Simkins. Jennifer blogged her [excellent notes][2] from the tour.

Things I went away excited about:

  * Planting some early season stuff, like spinach, kale and chard
  * Expanding our garden for next year by tarping over the future areas during this summer.
  * Building some small hoop-house structures with wire or PVC and something called &#8220;remay&#8221;. These can be used to protect against frost and bugs.
