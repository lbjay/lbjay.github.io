<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/l10n' target='_blank'>l10n</a> is geek shorthand for localization, which is what the Eat Local movement is all about (&#8230;except in the context of food and not software).

Anyway, you better [fill up the tank][1] and hit the farmer&#8217;s markets early this week: the [local-vores][2] will be swarming! Well, maybe not those particular vores, unless you&#8217;re [within 100 miles of the bay area][3].

Yep, today marks the beginning of the month-long [2007 Eat Local Challenge][4]. Apparently it&#8217;s the third year in a row. Depending on your level of commitment, you can participate in many different ways and at many different levels of effort; everything from &#8220;take photos of local food&#8221;, to &#8220;Can, freeze, or dehydrate your local summer bounty&#8221;.

First on my agenda is [roasting ][5]10 lbs of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marzano_tomato' target='_blank'>San Marzano</a> tomatoes, just procured from [my farm around the corner][6] as part of my CSA share.
