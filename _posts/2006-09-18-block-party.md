Our neighborhood had it&#8217;s 5th annual block party yesterday afternoon. Jenny &#038; I have been fixtures since year one. It takes place in the park right across the street from our house, so it&#8217;s almost like having a big party in our front yard.

Our contributions included a big dish of [pulled-pork BBQ][1] (saved and frozen from the previous weekend) and some hot dogs with [Sweet Jalapeno Relish][2]. An unidentifed attendee brought some really excellent baked beans that went well with the BBQ. Both received very good reviews.

One of my neighbors is a member of the [New England Barbeque Society][3] (NEBS) and an experienced BBQ judge; he gave the pork very high marks. The consensus on the relish was that it was really tasty but not hot enough, which is suprising considering [how many jalapenos][4] went into it. <img src="http://www.f00die.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
