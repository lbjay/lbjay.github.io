A shot of our new weekly menu chalkboard from earlier this week. 

Things don&#8217;t always go as planned, however. <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shephards_pie' target='_blank'>Shephard&#8217;s Pie</a> ended up on Tuesday, and Wednesday dinner consisted of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenway' target='_blank'> Fenway Franks</a> and $7 beers. Yep, that&#8217;s right&#8211;we managed to score tickets to Game 1 of the Red Sox vs Angels playoff series. Thanks Doug &#038; April!
