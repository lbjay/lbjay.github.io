Well, technically whey, which I sort of knew what that was, but looked it up on Wikipedia anyway to make sure. It is *&#8220;the liquid remaining after milk has been curdled and strained.&#8221;*

I was reading [this Slashfood post][1] which linked to [this article][2] on how the pickle industry may be in decline (yikes!) when I noticed in the comments someone linked to this article on [an interesting description of the process of lacto-fermentation][3]. Apparently the use of a vinegar brine is a recent development brought on by the industrialization of the pickling process.

> *Lactic acid is a natural preservative that inhibits putrefying bacteria. Starches and sugars in vegetables and fruits are converted into lactic acid by the many species of lactic-acid-producing bacteria. *

Sounds tasty! Be careful though: *&#8220;results are not always predictable.&#8221;*

There are lots of other interesting food-related articles on the [westonaprice.org][4] site, but I&#8217;d never heard about this organization. Something about the site seemed slightly&#8230; odd. I got curious and decided to dig a little to make sure I wasn&#8217;t linking to some weird cult or something. The Wikipedia entry on them is intriguing but pretty tame. The most controversial thing about them seems to be an aversion to soy. <img src="http://www.f00die.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
