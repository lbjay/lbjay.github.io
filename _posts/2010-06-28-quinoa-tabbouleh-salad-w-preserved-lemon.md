I say &#8220;salad&#8221; as this doesn&#8217;t have near the ratio of parsley to grains as a standard tabbouleh would have. Still, the ingredient list matches up. So far I&#8217;ve only made it using the Red Quinoa available from Trader Joe&#8217;s. Gives it a nice, hearty color.

As for the preserved lemons, this is something I&#8217;ve gotten into ever since a friend with a too-small kitchen unloaded a large mason jar of them on me. I&#8217;ve since made my own following [this guide][1]. It&#8217;s really remarkably easy and they give lots of dishes a remarkably tasty flavor. Jennifer loves them.
