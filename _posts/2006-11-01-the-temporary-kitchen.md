Been living with this setup for about a week now. It&#8217;s not so bad really. So far we subsisted on prepared stuff from Wilson Farm and takeout.

The coffee pot and toaster oven by themselves will dim the lights when warming up. And don&#8217;t even think about trying to use more than one at a time or the circuit breaker will trip. The fridge is still plugged in in the dining room on the other side of the house.
