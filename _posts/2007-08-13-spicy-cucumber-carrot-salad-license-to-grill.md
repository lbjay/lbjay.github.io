Made this on Saturday with the first of our harvested habanero peppers. The recipe called for any type of hot pepper to suit your heat preference. I used about 1/2 of a seeded habanero and it was ***hot***. An excellent, gradually building heat; the kind where you almost don&#8217;t notice your mouth&#8217;s on fire until you push the plate away.

* 2 t grated fresh ginger  
* 1 t grated fresh garlic  
* 1/2 habanero pepper, seeded and minced  
* 1/4 cup rice vinegar  
* 1 T thai fish sauce (nam pla)  
* 2 sizeable cukes, seeded if you prefer  
* 2 medium carrots  
* a couple of ice cubes

Mix the first six ingredients together in a large bowl. Peel and slice the cukes and carrots (I used my mandoline to get them pretty thin). Add the veggies to the dressing and toss. Before serving, add in a couple of ice cubes and toss some more. According to the original recipe this is supposed to crisp up the veggies, and I can attest that they were crisp. <img src="http://blog.reallywow.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
