We can&#8217;t stop the tomatoes; we only try to contain them.

We&#8217;re getting 10 lbs a week from the farm share these days, plus nearly that much from the garden. Two weekends in a row included a peel & seed session and a batch of [crockpot red sauce][1]. Three gallons in the freezer so far, separated into 1 quart containers.

Today also involved some [tomato peeling & seeding][2], but this time for gazpacho. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on in the background of the photo. In the foreground you see the ingredients for some salsa verde (sans the zucchini) that will be constructed later on today. Below is the rough recipe I went by. It&#8217;s crimped from both Cook&#8217;s Illustrated and Bittman&#8217;s [HTCE][3] with adjustments for what I had and how I like it.

    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">

    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      <span class="quantity">2</span> <span class="item">garlic cloves</span>
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      <span class="quantity">2 rounds</span> <span class="item">pita bread</span>
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      <span class="quantity">2 t</span> <span class="item">salt</span>
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      <span class="quantity">1/2 t</span> <span class="item">fresh ground black pepper</span>
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      <span class="quantity">1/3 cup</span> <span class="item">good quality white wine vinegar</span>
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      <span class="quantity">1/2 cup</span> <span class="item">good quality olive oil</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="method">
    Peel, seed and loosely chop the tomatoes and the cucumbers. Preserve as much of the juice from these as you can, discarding the skins, seeds and pulp.
  </p>
  
  <p class="method">
    Chop or tear the pita bread into chunks and soak in the reserved juice plus water to cover if necessary
  </p>
  
  <p class="method">
    Working in batches if necessary (and unless you have an industrial sized Cuisinart, it will be,) load up a food processor with all the ingredients except the olive oil. Pulse a few times, then leave on for 20-30 seconds to get everything very well blended. With the machine still on, slowly drizzle in the olive oil. <span class="note">Note: since it&#8217;s all going to get stirred together in the end I don&#8217;t worry about perfectly divided batches; for instance, i&#8217;ll do all the bread with the first batch and all the olive oil in the last</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="method">
    Pour each batch into a large, non-reactive container and chill for a couple of hours before serving.
  </p>
  
  <p class="method">
    There&#8217;s several additional things you can do to spruce this up for serving:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      chop up another pita round into bite size pieces, toss with olive oil and toast to make crutons
    </li>
    <li>
      finely chop another cucumber and/or tomato and use to top each bowl
    </li>
    <li>
      drizzle with more olive oil
    </li>
  </ul>
