We&#8217;ve signed up with a new [CSA][1]that will be providing a couple of winter share distributions. The first is set to hit the bin this coming Saturday. According to the newsletter it will include the following:

* Sweet Potatoes  
* Potatoes  
* Parsnips  
* Turnips

(nice!)

* Rutabaga  
* Carrots  
* Beets  
* Celeriac  
* Collards  
* Kale

(stop it, you&#8217;re spoiling me)

* Winter Squash  
* Brussels Sprouts  
* Cabbage  
* Leeks  
* Salad mix  
* Radicchio  
* Spinach  
* Kohlrabi

(OMG, more?)

* Red Onions  
* Fennel  
* Arugula  
* Braising Mix  
* Bok choi

Can&#8217;t wait to find out what **Braising Mix** is. Next week&#8217;s menu is going to be a blast to write up.
