Like most enchilada recipes, this one has more steps than I typically prefer for a weeknight meal. I was, however, perfect for a pre-holiday vacation day. The recipe is slightly tweaked from the original in [Didi Emmon&#8217;s Vegetarian Planet][1].

For the filling:

  * 4-5 medium russet potatoes
  * 1 medium butternut squash
  * 2 T olive oil
  * 1 t dried oregano
  * 1 t salt
  * 1/2 t pepper

Peel and slice the potato and squash into 3/4 inch cubes. Toss with the oil, oregano and salt and pepper. Roast in a 400 degree oven for about 30-40 minutes, until browning and easily pierced with a sharp knife.

For the mole sauce:

  * 1 T olive oil
  * 1 cup diced onion
  * 2 garlic cloves, minced
  * 1 handful of almonds (about 16)
  * 1 can diced tomatoes, drained
  * 1/2 ripe plantain, peeled and cut into 1/2 inch rounds (I used a banana instead, but plantain would be better)
  * 1/4 tsp cinnamon
  * pinch ground cloves
  * 1 jalapeno, roasted & peeled (I used a chipotle packed in adobo sauce&#8211;it rocked)
  * dash of salt

Saute the onion, garlic and almonds until onion is softened and translucent. Add the tomatoes, plantain and spices and cook over medium heat for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add jalapeno and salt, and puree in a food processor or with an immersion blender.  
The rest:

  * 8 flour tortillas
  * 8 oz Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
  * 1 bunch scallions, chopped thin
  * sour cream

Spread some of the roasted potato & squash mixture on each tortilla. Top with some of the cheese. Roll them up and load them into an oiled rectangular baking pan. Spread the sauce over the top. Cover with foil. Bake at 400 for 25 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle with the chopped scallions, bake for another 10 minutes.

Serve with big blobs of sour cream on top.
