Last week, when Jenny &#038; I were in Little Rock, there were several conversations concerning *where do we eat tonight?* One suggestion that kept popping up was,* how about the Italian couple*, some new restaurant that was receiving lots of buzz. During all these conversations Jenny &#038; I assumed this &#8220;Italian couple&#8221; label was just some kind of shorthand or nickname because no one could remember or pronounce the actual name. Well, that was the actual name, *The Italian Couple*. Aaaaaand we never ended up eating there.

Anyway, last night we at at our own personal *Italian Couple*: Stefano &#038; Grazia, some newish friends of ours, originally from Roma &#038; Napoli, respectively. Stephano is probably more of a foodie than I&#8217;ll ever be, and the two of them treated us to a fantastic dinner.

We started with a plate of cold, poached shrimp w/ avocado, follwed by smoked salmon served w/ the usual accompaniments. The main course was a pork tenderloin wrapped in puffed pastry w/ sauted mushrooms and a big bowl of some of the best green beans I&#8217;ve ever had. Much thanks to both Stefano &#038; Grazia.
