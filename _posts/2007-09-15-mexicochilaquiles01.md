It&#8217;s actually been a few months since I made <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilequiles' target='_blank'>Chilequiles,</a> but [Pam ][1] was asking for recipes for good, healthy, week-long-leftovers dishes. This one&#8217;s a staple. For the greens I&#8217;ve used both spinach and chard. I also really like it with the addition of poached and shredded chicken breasts which wasn&#8217;t in the original <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moosewood_Restaurant' target='_blank'>Moosewood</a> recipe.  
<br clear="all" />

What follows is somewhat approximate (since I&#8217;m pulling it out of memory). Also, I know it&#8217;s a little [can-o-this, can-o-that][2], but it&#8217;s a casserole for cryin&#8217; out loud. Get over yourself.

**Note**: for the chicken, I usually simmer a couple of boneless breasts in just enough water or chicken broth to cover until done (about 10-12 minutes). For the cooked greens I clean and loosely chop them and then steam in a steamer pot.

* 2 T canola oil  
* 1 medium yellow onion  
* 1 can diced tomatoes, drained  
* 1 can black beans, drained and rinsed  
* 2 cups corn kernels  
* 1 t black pepper  
* 3 T fresh lime juice  
* 2 cups cooked, shredded chicken  
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro  
* 2 cups cooked spinach, chard or other greens  
* 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese  
* 2 cups crushed tortilla chips  
* 1 jar salsa

Preheat oven to 350°.

Dice the onion and sauté in the oil over med-high heat. When it becomes translucent add the tomatoes and sauté for another five minutes to let some of the juices cook off. Stir in the beans, corn, black pepper and lime juice and cook until heated through. Off heat toss in the shredded chicken and cilantro.

Spread 1 1/2 cups of the crushed corn chips on the bottom of a casserole dish, saving the rest to sprinkle on top. Spoon 1/2 of the tomato/corn/beans mixture into an even layer in the dish. Top with half the salsa and then half the shredded cheese. Spread the cooked greens for the next layer, then, in succession, the rest of the tomato/corn/beans, the rest of the salsa, the rest of the corn chips and finally the cheese on top. Bake for 25 minutes.
