We recently ate for the first time at an Indian place in Somerville called The Kebab Factory. The word of mouth was that the food was great (it was) if a little overpriced (also true).

The service was just OK. Mostly little things, like we asked for a table for five, waited for 30 minutes in a pub across the street, and then were given a table for four. Fortunately some other diners were just finishing, so were were able to move to a larger space after a few more minutes. Our waiter was very pleasant, but the girl who was assisting him was kind of&#8230; hmm, brusque?

My primary issue was that a good 20-30 minutes after everyone at the table had clearly finished eating, no one on the staff bothered to clear a single item from our table. I finally had to make this kind of awkward, irritated sweeping gesture to communicate that maybe it was a good time for them to clear some plates. This really, really drives me nuts. Also, I asked that the leftovers from Jenny&#8217;s and my meal be wrapped up but I guess I was misunderstood and they ended up in the trash because I was never brought a &#8220;doggie bag&#8221;.

In case this seem a little harsh, let me remind you that this was no mom-and-pop Indian joint (like the excellent [India Palace][1]). The Kebab Factory is getting $15-25 for an entree.

But wait, there&#8217;s more.

Afterwards we strolled down to Harvard Sq. for some ice cream at Toscanini&#8217;s. We were served by two dudes in dreadlocks. I bought my ice cream and ate it and it was good and I&#8217;m sure it didn&#8217;t have any cooties in it, but thinking back on it, I&#8217;m kinda grossed out. Last time I checked, one of the steps involved in forming dreadlocks is *not washing your hair for several months*. Surely there&#8217;s some kind of health dept. regulation that requires food workers to wash their hair? Honestly, I&#8217;m not anti-dread; I&#8217;m pro-hair-washing.
