[Fascinating][1].

My favorite is the gas range. I like how when everything is off the flat lever controls make a nice straight line, giving you a visual clue, even from a distance, that one of the burners is on. Don Norman would approve.

My least favorite aspect? Probably the submarine galley nature of it all: exposed pipes, that hulking gas hot water heater, and the 6&#8243; threshold between the kitchen and the bathroom. I hope they keep a good supply of [incense matches][2] in there.
