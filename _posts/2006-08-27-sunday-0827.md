Inspired by a fresh head of romaine from our [CSA][1], I tossed together a caesar salad. Instead of crutons we had this odd flatbread called Torta de Aceita. I was trying to find somethingÂ  crouton-ish at [Wilson Farm][2] and it looked intriguing. Turns out it&#8217;s like a crackery, olive-oil shortbread, with anise seeds and sugar sprinkled on top. Very tasty, but not exactly something you would toss with a ceasar salad.

Dish #2 was just some chopped roma tomatoes tossed with <font size="-1">Mozzarella Di Buffala, basil and a splash of balsamic vinegar.</font>
