Thought of another thing to add to [my list][1]: faux lump crab meat. You know, the stuff where the ingredients list consisted entirely of the vague &#8220;whitefish&#8221;.

I worked at a Subway briefly in college. I used to eat the crap out of those seafood salad subs. And when I was mixing up the &#8220;seafood&#8221; & mayo in the back, if any stray bits of meat were left I&#8217;d eat those too.
