Got this recipe via my CSA newsletter. It works for all kinds of greens&#8211;spinach, kale, chard, etc.&#8211; but my favorite is with broccoli rabe (aka, rapini). I&#8217;ve tweaked it a little and added a bit of acid in the form of lemon juice or vinegar towards the end of the cooking.

* 2 T olive oil  
* 1 medium onion  
* garlic to taste (or not&#8211;I&#8217;ve actually been leaving this out)  
* 2 medium carrots in 1/4 inch dice  
* 1 bunch broccoli rabe, coarsely chopped  
* 1/2 &#8211; 1 cup chicken or veggie broth or water  
* 1 can diced tomatoes or 3 or four medium tomatoes peeled and chopped  
* 2 T lemon juice or red wine vinegar  
* 6 medium-large eggs  
* salt &#038; pepper to taste

In a large saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, saute onion until translucent. Add garlic (if any) and saute 30 seconds more. Add carrots and stir. Add the greens. The greens should have some water clinging to the leaves from when you rinsed and drained them in a collander. If not, increase the amount of water/broth you add. Toss the greens with the onions and carrots. Saute until the greens wilt enough that you can fit the lid on the pan. 

Turn the heat to low and braise for 5-15 minutes depending on the type of greens you&#8217;re using. i.e., 5 minutes for spinach, 10 for rabe. For tough collards you may have to go as long as 30 minutes (and increase the amount of liquid). Uncover and stir in the tomatoes and the acid. Cover and cook another 5 minutes. 

Ok, now we&#8217;re going to add the eggs. Uncover the pan. With the back of a spoon make six depressions in the vegetables. There should still be enough liquid in the pan at this point that the eggs will poach. If there&#8217;s no liquid in the bottom of your depressions, add more and put the lid back on until everything is back to as simmer. Carefully crack an egg into each depression. Cover the pan and cook for another 3-5 minutes, or until the eggs are mostly set (they&#8217;ll continue to cook and harden a bit more even after you turn off the heat). 

Serve over rice or quinoa.
