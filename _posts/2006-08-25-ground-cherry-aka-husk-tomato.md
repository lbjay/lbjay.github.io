[<img width="138" height="138" align="right" alt="Ground Cherry" title="Ground Cherry" src="http://www.slowfoodusa.org/ark/images/Auntmollystomato.jpg" />][1]Thanks to Danielle at [Habeus Brulee][2] for posting about [these][3] tasty looking thing-a-bobs. They look a bit like tomatillos, which Jenny &#038; I have been [growing successfully][4] for a few years, but taste more like a tropical fruit I guess. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve never seen seedlings for sale around here, so I&#8217;ll have to look into getting some seeds.
