Great book. Probably you&#8217;ve heard of it. Deservedly one of the NYT Review of Books Top 10 for 2006. I also recommend browsing Michael Pollan&#8217;s [site ][1]where he links to lots of online lectures and podcast interviews.

So here&#8217;s some decisions/ideas that came about as a result of reading [The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma][2].

  1. No more supermarket eggs for me.
  2. Maybe wild mushroom hunting isn&#8217;t really so scary.
  3. I will always love corn, but it is difficult now to look at a delicious, grilled ear of corn or a slice of cornbread or a bowl of corn chowder the same way.
  4. Those .99 cent cheeseburgers don&#8217;t really cost .99 cents&#8211;spread the word.
  5. How does eating local scale to feed more than just an elite handful of the relatively wealthy and/or an extremely dedicated and hard-working subset of the population? Is &#8220;local&#8221; and &#8220;scale&#8221; actually an oxymoron?

Next on my list is a similar book, [Against The Grain][3], by Richard Manning. What I think was an excerpt from the book was published in Harper&#8217;s as [The Oil We Eat][4], and I&#8217;m really looking forward to the full length treatment.
