The blurb read: *&#8220;the result of a marriage between Southern Italian Cuisine and Peruvian Cuisine.&#8221;* Sounds scary, no? Well, when your only possible complaint of an evening is that your water glass sat empty for a bit too long, I&#8217;d call that a winner.

After a stroll on the [Pru SkyWalk][1] with Dad &#038; Myra, we all headed for the North End for dinner. Fearing a crush of fellow Friday night diners, I had made reservations through [OpenTable][2] at [Taranta][3], a place I&#8217;d never heard of. In retrospect, the neighborhood was uncrowded and we probably could have gotten in at Maurizio&#8217;s or (are you kidding?) Giacamo&#8217;s.

It was the final day of [Boston Restauarant Week][4], and we were presented with the prix fixe, $30.06 menu. I won&#8217;t detail everyone&#8217;s meal, but I had a caesar salad, skirt steak with peach chutney, peruvian asparagus (just like regular asparagus as far as I could tell) and roasted potatoes, and for dessert, a chocolate hazelnut mousse thingy.
