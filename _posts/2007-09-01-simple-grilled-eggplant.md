[BÃ©a ][1] asks for favorite eggplant recipes. I only have one way I like to cook it these days. It&#8217;s a recipe shared verbally by an Israeli co-worker.

    Simple Grilled Eggplant
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;ve got no measurements for you, but it&#8217;s simple enough. The ratio of lemon juice to tahini is the only part that took some experimentation. And it&#8217;s really best to use the fat/round varieties, like Dusky or &#8220;Italian&#8221;, rather than the long/skinny kinds&#8211;unless you&#8217;re really into eggplant skin, which I am not.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    * Eggplant<br /> * Olive Oil<br /> * Lemon Juice<br /> * Tahini
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Slice the eggplant crosswise into discs about 1/2 inch thick. Sprinkle both sides of each slice with a pinch of salt and toss them into a collander to sit for half an hour or so. Go fire up the grill while you&#8217;re waiting. You can also prepare the dressing/drizzle: whisk together in a bowl 2 parts lemon juice to one part tahini. For 2 good-sized eggplants this means about 2 T Tahini + 1/4 cup lemon juice.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By the time your fire&#8217;s ready, the eggplant should have weeped out some of its slightly-bitter moisture. Wipe both sides of each slice with a paper towel to dry them and also remove some of the salt. Brush them with olive oil and spread them out in a single layer on the grill. Grill on both sides until they&#8217;ve developed some good grill marks and have lost their firmness. Pile the slices on a plate and drizzle with the lemon + Tahini mixture.
