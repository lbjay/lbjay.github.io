Picking up our first weekly share today. It ante&#8217;s up the challenge of planning a menu for the week when you&#8217;re not sure what you&#8217;re getting and how much of it. Fortunately, the new CSA seems like they&#8217;re going to be good about e-mailing [weekly guesstimates][1].

The weather acts as a foil as well. I can pencil in &#8220;Grilled Chicken Breasts&#8221;, but they might end up being stuffed and baked instead (and vice-versa).

##### Sunday

  * Grilled Chicken Breasts
  * Hobo Potatoes w/ Fennel Fronds & Arugula
  * Spinach or Bok Choy (in the grill basket)

##### Monday

  * [Saag Aloo][2] (w/ leftover potatoes)
  * Basmati Rice
  * Salad

##### Tuesday

  * Fish w/ Ginger & Tomatoes
  * Leftover rice
  * Napa slaw w/ Mango
  * Salad

##### Wednesday

  * Leftovers

##### Thursday

  * Grilled Tofu
  * Grilled Zucchini
  * Tomato Crostinis

##### Friday

  * [Radish & Cucumber Salad][3] (w/ leftover tofu)
  * Sauted Spinach or Bok Choy
  * ???
