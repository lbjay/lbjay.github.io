Yes, that&#8217;s right: you can help &#8220;save Britain&#8217;s vegetable heritage&#8221; by adopting a vegetable at [GardenOrganic.org][1].

I seem to remember a similar &#8220;seed bank&#8221; organization on this side of the Atlantic but I can&#8217;t find the link right now. And I don&#8217;t remember them having such a novel method of raising funds. Reminds me a little of the [Heifer Project][2].
