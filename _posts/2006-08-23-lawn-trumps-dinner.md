Last night the plan was to hit the [Farmer&#8217;s Market][1] for dinner, but Jenny reminded me that the lawn could use a mowing before the AR parents arrived today. So I fired up the ol&#8217; Briggs &#038; Stratton and gave the crabgrass a trim.

Instead of some fresh cod braised over succotash, we had frozen Trader Joe&#8217;s tamales. I threw together a little side-dish made of leftover brown rice from the previous night&#8217;s Thai takeout, a rinsed can of black beans, and the remnants of some homemade salsa verde. It was pretty tasty.
