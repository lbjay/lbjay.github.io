I&#8217;ve always stuck with a pretty basic salsa fresca recipe when using tomatillos in the past, but this time I decided to try more of a sauce-ish preparation. We had a little impromptu patio, grill-fest with our immediate neighbors and the consensus was that it came out excellent.

  * about 20 medium sized tomatillos
  * 1 small shallot, chopped
  * 1 garlic clove
  * 3 chipotl√© peppers (smoked jalapenos)
  * 1/3 cup canola oil
  * 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
  * 1/2 tsp salt

Put everything in a non-reactive saucepan, bring to a boil, and then simmer for 15 minutes. Let cool a bit and then zap it with an immersion blender until mixed (but still slightly chunky).

This was great just as a salsa w/ chips, and also with various grilled meats that were on hand, including chicken, sirloin tips and swordfish.
