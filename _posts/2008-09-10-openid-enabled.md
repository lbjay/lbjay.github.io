Yep. I installed the [OpenID WordPress plugin][1]. Not super useful since I&#8217;m the only one who really needs to log in. But the plugin author [plans][2] to add server and delegation capabilities, so eventually I could be my own OpenID provider (not that I [couldn&#8217;t already][3] if I really wanted).
