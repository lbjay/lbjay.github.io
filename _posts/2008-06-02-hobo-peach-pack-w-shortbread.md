We did a mixed grill thing w/ some friends last night using several meat share items: a ribeye, a sirloin, some lamb kebabs and some garlic+cheese pork sausage. After pulling the meat I threw on a hobo pack of fresh peaches and let it sit while we polished off dinner.

  * 6 peaches
  * 2 T butter
  * 2 T brown sugar
  * 4 small shortbread cakes
  * 1 cup plain yogurt (greek style preferably&#8211;I&#8217;m a fan of the [Fage][1] stuff)
  * 4 T honey

Peel, pit and slice the peaches. Lay out two square sheets of foil on top of each other. Spray the center with non-stick spray or canola oil spray. Pile the peach slices in the middle. Sprinkle with the brown sugar and dot with the butter. Lay another square of foil over the top and roll up the edges to seal the pack.

While you&#8217;re eating whatever it was you fired up the grill for, let the hobo pack sit over the dying coals. When you&#8217;re ready for desert, pull them off. Put a shortbread in each of four bowls. Divvy up the peaches over the shortbread. Spoon a big dollop of yogurt on each and finally drizzle each with a tablespoon of honey.

I&#8217;ve also grilled unpeeled peach halves directly on the grill grates, and this can be good too. However, peaches are [notorious for soaking up pesticides][2]. Most of that is going to be in the skin, so I figure a hobo pack is the way to go, even though you may not get that nice, smoky &#8220;grill flavor&#8221;.
