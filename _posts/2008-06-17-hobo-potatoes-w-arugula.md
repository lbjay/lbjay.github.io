Is it a green? Is it a herb? Don&#8217;t care. Love it.

Arugula makes a really simple addition to potatoes of any kind. I&#8217;ve added handfuls of fresh arugula to smashed potatoes, but it&#8217;s too hot for boiling potatoes these days. I prefer to keep the cooking outside on the grill, which means hobo packs.

    Hobo Potatoes w/ Arugula
  </h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li class="ingredient">
      <span class="quantity">6</span><span class="item"> all-purpose potatoes</span>, <span class="note">medium-sized</span>
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      <span class="quantity">4 T</span> <span class="item">olive oil</span>
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      <span class="item">salt & pepper</span> <span class="note">(any kind of seasoned salt works well, too)</span>
    </li>
    <li class="ingredient">
      <span class="quantity">2 cups</span> <span class="item">arugula</span>, <span class="note">loosely chopped</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p class="method">
    Give the potatoes a good scrubbing but don&#8217;t peel. Cut them in half lengthwise and then slice into 1/4 inch thick half-circles. Toss with the olive oil and s & p.
  </p>
  
  <p class="method">
    Lay out two sheets of heavy-duty foil, one on top of the other. Spread a little extra olive oil in the middle of the sheet and pile on 1/2 the potatoes. Lay another square sheet of foil on top so that the edges line up. Fold up each side of the square to seal in the pack. Lay the packs directly on the grill over at least medium heat. They&#8217;ll need to cook for ~20 minutes. Move/turn them around frequently to make sure everything&#8217;s cooking evenly. You should be able to hear the contents inside sizzling.
  </p>
  
  <p class="method">
    Put the chopped arugula in a good-sized serving bowl. Pull the packs off the grill and carefully open one side. Check that the potatoes are done. If not just reseal and leave on the grill a little longer (or abort and nuke them in the microwave&#8211;but not in the foil!) Assuming the potatoes are done, you should be able to tip the contents of each into the bowl on top of the arugula. Toss the hot potatoes with the arugula and serve.
