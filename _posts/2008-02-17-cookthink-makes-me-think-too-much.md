I came across what I thought sounded like a good &#8220;Web 2.0&#8243; foodie site today: [Cookthink.com][1]

After a couple of search attempts I&#8217;m wondering if maybe I&#8217;m missing something. The UI is not immediately grok-able. And no matter what I indicate I&#8217;m &#8220;craving&#8221; I end up at a recipe for [Avocado Crostini][2]. Setting aside the fact that I really love Avocado Crostini, I don&#8217;t see the connection to the terms I was putting in&#8211;gnocchi, italian. I can only assume that the site hasn&#8217;t collected enough tag information to give reliable recommendations. That or it just knows me better than I think.
