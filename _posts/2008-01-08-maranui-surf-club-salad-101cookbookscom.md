I thought I had some coconut milk, but I didn&#8217;t. Doh! Ended up substituting almond milk + some butter (to kick up the fat a little). It was awesome anyway, but I still stocked up on coconut milk for next time.

To accompany it I fried up some tofu slices coated in a mixture of panko and thin-sliced scallions. Went great with a bottle of Bonny Doon Pacific Rim Riesling.

Thanks to Angela for the recipe heads-up.
