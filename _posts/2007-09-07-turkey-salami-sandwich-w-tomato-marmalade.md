I made some [Tomato Marmalade][1] last week but haven&#8217;t had many things that it seemed appropriate to put it on. I had the notion that it would be good on a sandwich with salami and red onion&#8230; and wah-lah [sic].

<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challah' target='_blank'>Challah</a> bread from [Hi-Rise][2]. Bibb lettuce and red onion from the [farmer&#8217;s market][3]. A slice of roasted turkey breast and a couple of slices of hard salami. Swiss cheese. A slathering of Tomato Marmalade.
